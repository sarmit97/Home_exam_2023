# Home_exam_2023
This project was created for a home exam in BIO302. The .qmd file provided in this repository includes only a part of the exam - Task 1 in Part A - as requested by the professor. 

To open the project in Rstudio, the newest version of Rstudio is required - 2023.03.1. 
The data that has been used in this first exercise is imported from this paper:
Citation: Freitas, C. et al. (2016) Data. Ecology and Evolution. https://doi.org/10.1002/ece3.1496

The packages needed in the first exercise are given in the second code chunk. However, as the exam contains more exercises that are not included in this .qmd file of this repository, only a few of the packages are needed to runt he codes for this exercise 1 of part A. 
The following packages need to be installed with install.packages("") and be loaded using library(): 
here()
readxl()
ggplot2()
tidyverse()
dplyr()

The first code chunk follows the description of the exam exercises that follow Exercise 1 in Part A. After the description of the exam, one will find the first code chunks used in this exercise.
